	<h2> Dark Souls 1 </h2>
	<h4> "Prepare to Die" </h4>
<section>
	<h3> Overview </h3>
	Dark Souls 1 released for PS3 and XBOX 360 in the US on October 4th, 2011. The PC version, running through the now defunked Games for Windows Live service, released later on August 24th, 2012. The game would recieve critical acclaim for its crushing difficulty and left journalists comparing most other games' difficulties to the game. The game would later recieve a remaster during 2018 which would vastly improve the back-end of the game in it's coding, while leaving the core experience intact for fans of the franchise. The game sees a community ran event called "Return to Lordran" each year, where community members are encouraged to start a new character and play through the game as normal. The game sets you into a walled off asylum off to the north in the land of Lordran, just after creating your character. The difficulty is made apparent to the player in the tutorial area, which is the asylum, by making the player kill their first boss in order to leave the area.
<br/>
<br/>
	One of the core themes in the game is a disease called "hollowing" that afflicts all inhabitants of the game world. The process of hollowing is described as dying again and again, until the person goes insane. Most enemies you fight throughout the game have hollowed to this point, and it is the player's job to fight through all of them and make a grave choice at the end of their journey. In order to remove the hollowing curse and perpetuate the god's age of fire, the player must sacrifice themselves by offering themselves as kindling for the first flame. The first flame is where all life in the world came from. The player, alternatively, can walk away from the dying flame and usher in an age of darkness, which is represented by humanity.

	<h3> Timeline of Events </h3>
	Opening cutscene shows the gods waking up and aquiring powerful souls through the first flame, then initiating the war with the everlasting dragons. Cutscene shows the process of hollowing and the land of Lordran. Chosen Undead (The Player) wakes up in a cell in the asylum. Oscar of Astora helps the player by giving them a key to their cell. The chosen undead sets out on a quest to link the first flame. After fighting through the dungeons and bosses of the game, the player is presented with the choice of which ending to go for. Both endings signify that this process of linking is a loop, and will happen again.
