	<h2> Dark Souls 2 </h2>
	<h4> "Go Beyond Death" </h4>
<section>
	<h3> Overview </h3>
	Dark Souls 2 released for PS3 and XBOX 360 in the US on March 11th, 2014. The PC version released on the platform Steam later on April 24th, 2014. The game originally was poorly recieved due to a troubled development cycle and broken promises from the E3 events from previous years. The game's lighting system was just not up to par, and the game mechanics were at best mediocre. The netcode for the online mode was also completely broken, resulting in constant latency issues from both parties. It later received a remaster which vastly improved everything in the game, this was released for PS4, XBOX One, and PC in 2015. The game opens with a nameless undead wandering to the gates of a lost kingdom, named "Drangleic". The nameless undead sets out on a quest upon arrival to aquire the major souls found in the land, and link the flame. The player can, however choose to explore other lost kingdoms and unlock the power of the king's crowns to permenantly cure themselves of hollowing and step out of the cycle completely. The community puts together a "Return to Drangleic" event similar to Dark Souls 1's event each year.

<br/>
	The theme of hollowing stays strong through this entry, as well as torture and disregard for hollows. The game plays with the idea of the curse of hollowing by allowing the player to completely remove themselves from the curse and the cycle of linking the flame. This, however, does not stop other hollows from perpetuating this viscious cycle.

	<h3> Timeline of Events </h3>
	The now-fallen kingdom of Drangleic was built after several linkings of the fire, set on top of the old Land of Lordran. This becomes a very prevelant theme in the 3rd entry. The nameless undead sets out to aquire the major souls found in the kingdom, with the hope that they will cure the curse of hollowing. The Fire Keeper, named Emerald Herald, directs the character through the game. Upon reaching Drangleic Castle, the nameless undead is met with Aldia, who informs them of their choice of linking the fire or gathering the crowns. No matter how the game ends, the player knows the cycle will continue.
