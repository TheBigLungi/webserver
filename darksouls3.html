	<h2> Dark Souls 3 </h2>
	<h4> "Embrace the Darkness Within" </h4>
<section>
	<h3> Overview </h3>
	Dark Souls 3 released for PS4, XBOX One, and PC in the US on April 12th, 2016. The game originally received critical acclaim for its return to the style of combat used in Dark Souls 1, with a few additions. The weapon art system was implemented for weapons to give each weapon a unique attack/style. A returning feature from a different game made by From Software, the MP bar, was also introduced. This was used to cast magic and use weapon arts. The nostalgia factors, however, prove to be a detriment to the game as it feels to afraid to take any leaps or risks to challenge the player. The game is still the same old difficult Dark Souls, but thats just it. The online player versus player is what keeps the community active as of now. There are no community events for this game.

	The theme of this game is the deterioration of the world as the cycle continues. It is mostly masked throughout the game until it reveals itself in the DLCs and the end of the game. You can see that the new kingdom of Lothric is built upon a mound of ruined buildings from the previous games turned to ash. You are no longer an undead, rather an unkindled, who failed to link the flame in the past. The objective of the game is to aquire the blood of the Dark Soul for a painter to paint a new world for the inhabitants to live in. She claims she will paint a "cold, dark, gentle place."

	<h3> Timeline of Events </h3>
	The unkindled one wakes up in the graveyard of ash, and seeks out their Fire Keeper. Upon reaching Firelink Shrine, the unkindled sets out to kill the lords of cinder that have abandoned their thrones to use their ashes to link the flame. On the way, the player meets Slave Knight Gael, who offers them a scrap of painting which sucks the player into the painted world. Here, the player locates a girl Gael spoke of, who wishes to paint a new world. This gives the player the indication that they need to help Gael get the blood of the Dark Soul to give to the painter. Fighting through the levels of the game, the player will find themselves at the Dreg Heap, a mound of kingdoms long lost reduced to ash. Markings left by Gael guide the player through to The Ringed City, the resting place of the Dark Soul. After fighting through the city, the player ends up at presumably the end of the world, where everything has nearly turned to ash. Gael has taken the Dark Soul and turned into an insatiable hollow, forcing the player to fight him. The end of the series sits with 2 nobodies, fit for nothing, fighting over the single item that could save the world.
